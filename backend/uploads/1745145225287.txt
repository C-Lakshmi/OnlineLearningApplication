# California Housing Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a neural network model to predict housing prices in California using the California Housing dataset. The implementation is contained in a single Jupyter notebook (`california.ipynb`).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Required Python libraries (see below)

## Required Libraries
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:
```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Python and Jupyter are installed on your system
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```
3. Download the `claudee.ipynb` notebook file
4. Launch Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Navigate to and open the `claudee.ipynb` file

## Execution Instructions
1. The notebook is designed to be executed sequentially from top to bottom
2. Run each cell by selecting it and pressing `Shift+Enter` or by using the "Run" button in the Jupyter interface
3. The California Housing dataset will be automatically downloaded via scikit-learn's datasets module
4. All visualizations will be displayed inline in the notebook
5. The model training may take several minutes depending on your hardware

## Project Components
The notebook includes:
- Data loading and exploration
- Visualization of the dataset features and target variable
- Data preprocessing (scaling, train-test split)
- Neural network model implementation using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model training with early stopping
- Evaluation of model performance
- Visualization of predictions and errors
- Feature importance analysis

## Expected Outputs
When successfully executed, the notebook will produce:
- Various data visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps)
- Model summary and architecture
- Training history plots
- Performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)
- Predictions vs. actual values plot
- Feature importance visualization

## Notes
- The notebook includes detailed comments explaining each step
- Visualizations are created to provide insights into the data and model performance
- The neural network architecture includes dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- A custom feature importance method is implemented to explain the model's predictionss
